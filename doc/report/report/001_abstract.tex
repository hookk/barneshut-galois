Locality in algorithms using irregular structures is naturally difficult to improve. This document reviews a new approach to these algorithms in the form of two optimizations, which change how the structures are traversed. Three implementations of example algorithms are also described in this document: Barnes-Hut, Point Correlation and Ray Tracing. These examples are parallelized using the Galois framework. Measurements showed that only the first two examples got speedups, but all reduced cache miss rates considerably for the first two levels.
