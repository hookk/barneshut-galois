\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document follows the work described in \cite{tree_tiler}, where a framework called TreeTiler is presented, to optimize, at both compile time and run time, locality of algorithms relying on the traversal of recursive data structures.

In the following sections, the optimizations implemented in the TreeTiler framework are reviewed and applied to three test cases. These cases were selected to match the experiences performed in \cite{tree_tiler} and use the Galois framework (\cite{galois}) for parallelization. The goal of this document is to study the impact of these optimizations along with Galois.

\Cref{sec:tiler} explains the original work and the \treetiler framework, with a particular focus on the implemented optimizations in \cref{sec:optim}. In \cref{sec:cases} the implemented test cases and each of their particularities are explained. Measurement results are all presented in \cref{sec:results} with some final considerations and conclusions in \cref{sec:conclusion}. \Cref{sec:env,sec:method} detail the methodology and testing environment used to achieve the results shown.
