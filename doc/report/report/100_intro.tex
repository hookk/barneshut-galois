\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document follows the work described in \cite{tree_tiler}, where a framework called TreeTiler is presented, to optimize, at both compile time and run time, locality of algorithms relying on the traversal of recursive data structures.

\Cref{sec:tiler} explains the original work and the \treetiler framework, with a particular focus on the implemented optimizations in \cref{sec:optim}. In \cref{sec:cases} the implemented test cases and each of their particularities are explained. Measurement results are all presented in \cref{sec:results} with some final considerations and conclusions in \cref{sec:conclusion}. \Cref{sec:env,sec:method} detail the methodology and testing environment used to achieve the results shown.
