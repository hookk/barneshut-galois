\subsection{Two Point Correlation}
\label{sec:cases:pointcorr}

The Two Point Correlation algorithm is in many ways similar to the Barnes-hut. This application counts the pairs of points in a space which rely within a given radius of each other. It differs from the previous example in the acceleration structure -- a kD-Tree -- and in the need for a reduction to sum the pairs counted for each point.

Since this algorithm does not require any special data to be stored in the acceleration structure (the Barnes-hut requires that each node gives an estimation of its internal data), a simpler structure may be used. A kD-tree is a binary tree. In each level, the points are ordered by one of the coordinates, and the median is placed as a divider: everything
