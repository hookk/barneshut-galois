\section{Case Studies}
\label{sec:cases}

The studied optimizations, previously described in \cref{sec:optim} were applied to three different algorithms. The work focused mostly on the Spatial Sort and Point Blocking techniques. AutoTuner was not implemented, as this was not a generic framework like \treetiler, and as such there was no need for a tool to automatically determine the ideal parameters. The implemented test cases were:

\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Barnes-Hut}]
		This was the first test case, based on the implementation provided on the sample applications from the Galois framework. The acceleration structure used here was the already provided Octree.

	\item[\textbf{Point Correlation}]
		Implemented from scratch. In terms of implementation, it is mostly equivalent to that of the Barnes-Hut example, with the biggest difference being in the acceleration structure used, which is a kD-Tree rather than an Octree;

	\item[\textbf{Ray Tracer}]
		Based on a simple unoptimized implementation in OpenMP. A Bounding Volume Hierarchy implementation was designed for the acceleration structure.
\end{description}

\Cref{sec:cases:barnes,sec:cases:pointcorr,sec:cases:ray} explain with some more detail each test case.
