\todoline{THIS}
For the first test case, the Barnes-Hut implementation provided in the sample applications of the Galois framework was used.
This original implementation used an Octree as the acceleration structure, and served as a starting point to the usage of the Galois framework. Only the optimizations were left to implement.
