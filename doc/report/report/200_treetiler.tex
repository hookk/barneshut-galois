\section{TreeTiler}
\label{sec:tiler}

The work showed on \cite{tree_tiler} presents a framework, \treetiler, that can be used to refactor Java code at runtime. Given a Java application source code as input, \treetiler will try to detect a recursive data structure. It will then look for a recursive method that performs a recursive traversal on that structure.

The JastAdd framework is employed to analyze and refactor the Java input at compile time, generating the output consisting of the same program with the applied optimizations, which are described here.
