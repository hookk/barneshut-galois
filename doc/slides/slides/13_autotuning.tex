	\begin{itemize}
		\item Optimal block size is dependent on machine and algorithm details, and may also be input dependent
		% NOTE: machine details:   cache size
		% NOTE: algorithm details: optimal block size for barnes-hut is different than for ray tracer
		% NOTE: input dependency:  ray tracer with too few spheres will not benefit from blocking at all

		\item AutoTuner decides ideal block size at runtime
	\end{itemize}
