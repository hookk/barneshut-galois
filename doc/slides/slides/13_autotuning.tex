	\begin{itemize}\itemsep=20pt
		\item Optimal block size is dependent on machine and algorithm details, and may also be input dependent
		% NOTE: machine details:   cache size
		% NOTE: algorithm details: optimal block size for barnes-hut is different than for ray tracer
		% NOTE: input dependency:  ray tracer with too few spheres will not benefit from blocking at all

		\item AutoTuner decides ideal block size at runtime
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Performs random sampling to acquire a small subset of the test case (max. 1\% of the entire set)
		\end{itemize}

		\item \textbf{Not implemented in this work.} Only proves relevant on a more general framework.
